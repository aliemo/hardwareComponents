# Digital Systems Libraries, Modules, and IP Cores
This repository includes libraries, modules, and IP Cores that widely used in the design of digital systems.

## Supported Languages and Frameworks
- [**VHDL**](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1076-2019.html) (Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language) is a hardware description language used in electronic design automation to describe digital and mixed-signal systems such as field-programmable gate arrays and integrated circuits.

- [**Verilog**](https://www.verilog.com) is a Hardware Description Language; a textual format for describing electronic circuits and systems. Applied to electronic design, Verilog is intended to be used for verification through simulation, for timing analysis, for test analysis (testability analysis and fault grading) and for logic synthesis.

- [**SystemVerilog**](https://www.accellera.org/downloads/standards/v-ams), standardized as IEEE 1800, is a hardware description and hardware verification language used to model, design, simulate, test and implement electronic systems. SystemVerilog is based on Verilog and some extensions, and since 2008 Verilog is now part of the same IEEE standard.

- [**SystemC**](https://www.accellera.org/downloads/standards/systemc) is applied to system-level modeling, architectural exploration, performance modeling, software development, functional verification, and high-level synthesis. SystemC is often associated with electronic system-level (ESL) design, and with transaction-level modeling (TLM).

- [**myHDL**](https://github.com/myhdl/myhdl) is a free, open-source package for using Python as a hardware description and verification language.

- [**Chisel**](https://www.chisel-lang.org/) is a hardware design language that facilitates advanced circuit generation and design reuse for both ASIC and FPGA digital logic designs. Chisel adds hardware construction primitives to the Scala programming language, providing designers with the power of a modern programming language to write complex, parameterizable circuit generators that produce synthesizable Verilog. This generator methodology enables the creation of re-usable components and libraries, such as the FIFO queue and arbiters in the Chisel Standard Library, raising the level of abstraction in design while retaining fine-grained control.

* [**LegUp**](http://legup.eecg.utoronto.ca) is an open source high-level synthesis tool being developed at the University of Toronto. The LegUp framework allows researchers to improve C to Verilog synthesis without building an infrastructure from scratch. Our long-term vision is to make FPGA programming easier for software developers.
